<h1 id=3D"operational-description">Operational description</h1>

<p>This write up is rudimentary and assumes that the user is experienced wi=
th
computers, and as an example assumes a PC with a Windows OS.
Other systems operate essentially the same.</p>

<p>The WORDS program, Version 1.97E, with its accompanying data files shoul=
d
run on PC in Windows 95/98/NT, any monitor.  Simply download the
self-extracting EXE file and execute it in your chosen subdirectory/folder =
to
UNZIP the files into a subdirectory of a hard disk.  Then call WORDS.</p>

<p>There are a number of files associated with the program.  These must be =
in
the subdirectory/folder of the program, and the program must be run from th=
at
subdirectory.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORDS.E=
XE</code> is the executable program.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext hig=
hlighter-rouge">INFLECT.SEC</code> holds the
encoded inflection records.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-=
rouge">STEMFILE.GEN</code> contains the stems of the
GENERAL dictionary in a searchable form.
<code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DICTFILE.GEN</code> is=
 an indexed form of the GENERAL dictionary entries with form
information and meanings.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-ro=
uge">INDXFILE.GEN</code> contains a set of indexes into the
DICTFILE.  In some versions, there may be a set of files for a SPECIAL (.SP=
E)
dictionary of the same structure as the GENERAL dictionary, but there is
no SPECIAL dictionary in the present distribution.  A LOCAL dictionary may
also be used.  This is a limited dictionary of a different form, human
readable and writeable.  The knowledgeable user can augment and modify it
on-line.  It would consist of the file <code class=3D"language-plaintext hi=
ghlighter-rouge">DICT.LOC</code>.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext highli=
ghter-rouge">UNIQUES.LAT</code> contains
certain words which regular processing does not get.  <code class=3D"langua=
ge-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADDONS.LAT</code> contains
the set of prefixes, suffixes and enclitics (-que, -ve) and the like.
Other files may be generated by the program, so run it in a configuration
that allows the creation of files.</p>

<p>All these files are necessary to run the program (except the optional
dictionaries SPE and LOC).  This excess of files is a consequence of the
present developmental nature of the program.  The files are very simple,
almost human-readable.  Presumably, a later version could condense and
encode them.  Nevertheless, beyond the original COPY, the user need not
worry about them.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are files that the program may produce on request.
All of these share the name WORD, with various extensions, and they are
all ASCII/DOS text files which can be viewed and processed with an ordinary
editor.  The casual user may not want to get involved with
these.  <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD.OUT</code=
> will record the whole output, <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlight=
er-rouge">WORD.UNK</code> will list only
words the program is unable to interpret.  These outputs are turned on
through the PARAMETERS mechanism.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS may be changed while running the program by inputting a line
containing a =E2=80=98#=E2=80=99 mark as the only (or first) character.  Al=
ternatively,
<code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD.MOD</code> contai=
ns the MODES that can be set by CHANGE_PARAMETERS.  If this
file does not exist, default modes will be used.  The file may be produced
or changed when changing parameters.  It can also be modified, if the user
is sufficiently confident, with an editor, or deleted, thereby reverting
to defaults.</p>

<p>There is another set of developers parameters which may be set
with the input of =E2=80=98!=E2=80=99.  These MODES may be changed and save=
d in a
file <code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD.MDV</code>. =
 These are not normal user facilities, probably no one but
the developer would be interested.  In any specific release these
facilities may, or may not, work.  They are just mentioned here in case
they ever come up accidentally, and to point out that there are other
capabilities, actual and possible, which may be invoked if there is a
special need.  The user is invited to review these parameters to see
if any address an unusual need.</p>

<p><code class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD.OUT</code> is =
the file produced if the user requests
output to a file.  This output can be used for later manipulation with a
text editor, especially when the input was a text file of some length.  If
the parameter UNKNOWNS_ONLY is set, the output serves as a sort of a Latin
spell checker.  Those words it cannot match may just not be in the
dictionary, but alternatively they may be typos.  A <code class=3D"language=
-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD.UNK</code> file of
unknowns can be generated.</p>

<h2 id=3D"program-operation">Program Operation</h2>

<p>To start the program, in the subdirectory that contains all the files,
type WORDS.  A setup procedure will execute, processing files.  Then the
program will ask for a word to be keyed in.  Input the word and give a
return (ENTER).  Information about the word will be displayed.</p>

<p>One can input a whole line at a time, however long,
but only one line since the return
at the end of line will start the processing.  If the results would fill
more than a computer screen, the output is halted until the user responds
to the =E2=80=98MORE=E2=80=99 message with a return.  A file containing a t=
ext, a series
of lines, can be input by keying in the character =E2=80=98@=E2=80=99, foll=
owed (with no
spaces) by the DOS name of the file of text.  This input file need not be
in the program subdirectory, just use the full path and name of the
file.  This is usually accompanied with the setting of the parameter
switches to create and write to an output file, <code class=3D"language-pla=
intext highlighter-rouge">WORD.OUT</code>.</p>

<p>One can have a comment in the file, a terminal portion of a line that is
not parsed.  This could be an English meaning, a source where the word was
found, an indication that it may have been miscopied, etc.  A comment
begins with a double dash [=E2=80=93] and continues to the end of the line.=
  The
=E2=80=98=E2=80=93=E2=80=99 and everything after on that line is ignored by=
 the program.</p>

<p>A simple # character input at the start of a line (that is, a line
containing only #) will permit the user to set modes to prevent the
process from trying prefixes and suffixes to get a match on an item
unknown to the dictionary, put output to a file, etc.  Going into the
CHANGE_PARAMETERS, the =E2=80=98?=E2=80=99 character calls help for each en=
try.</p>

<p>Another set of parameters is invoked by the character !.  These develope=
r parameters
are fairly specialized and are probably not required by the average user,
nevertheless they are available for special applications.</p>

<p>Two successive returns with no text will terminate the program (except i=
n
text being read from an @ disk file.)</p>

<h2 id=3D"modes-of-operation">Modes of Operation</h2>

<p>The mode of operation of WORDS can be specialized by setting some combin=
ation
of available parameters.  Here are a couple of example situations.</p>

<p>If you want only meanings to show up, set the # parameter
<br>
DO_ONLY_MEANINGS =3D&gt; Yes
<br>
If you do not even want to see the dictionary form (principle parts) set</p=
>
<h1 id=3D"parameter">parameter</h1>
<p><br>
DO_DICTIONARY_FORM =3D&gt; No
<br>
If you want to accept only the dictionary entry (amo, but not amas), set
the ! parameter (this is the tricky one, requiring two parameters set)
<br>
DO_ONLY_INITIAL_WORD =3D&gt; Yes
<br>
This will ten require you to input one entry per line, which is not
unreasonable for a dictionary look-up process.  Then you will be offered
another, otherwise unavailable, option
<br>
FOR_WORD_LIST_CHECK =3D&gt; Yes
<br>
There are a large number of other options.  The user is invited
to consider all the options if needing anything more than the basic parse.<=
/p>

<p>Of course, for both sets of parameters, you will want to go to the end
of the parameter setting menu and save this set so you can restart with
the same situation.</p>

<h2 id=3D"command-line-operation">Command Line Operation</h2>

<p>The main mode of usage for WORDS is a simple call, followed by screen in=
teraction.</p>

<p>But there are other, command line, options.
WORDS may be called with arguments on the same line, in a number of differe=
nt modes.
The program will execute with these arguments as input.
Remember that the saved parameter settings (in <code class=3D"language-plai=
ntext highlighter-rouge">WORD.MOD</code> and <code class=3D"language-plaint=
ext highlighter-rouge">WORD.MDV</code>)
are controlling, even for command line input.</p>

<p>Single argument, either a simple Latin word or an input file.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS amo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br>which will cause it to execute for that input and then terminate.  T=
his is
for a quick word.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS infile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br>causes WORDS to execute with the contents of the infile.
The infile may be from any folder if the full path name is given.</p>

<p>With two arguments the options are: inputfile and outputfile,
two Latin words, or a language shift to English (Latin being the startup de=
fault)
and an English  word (with no part of speech).</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS infile outfile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br>The program will read as input the INFILE and write
the output to the OUTFILE (as though it were <code class=3D"language-plaint=
ext highlighter-rouge">WORD.OUT</code>).  It will then
await further input from the user.  It terminates with a return.  If the
parameters are not legal file names, the program will assume they are
Latin words to be processed as command line input.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS amo amas


WORDS ~e  love
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br>switches to English input from the default Latin and searches for lo=
ve.</p>

<p>With three arguments there could be three Latin words or a language shif=
t
and and English word and part of speech.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS amo amas amat


WORDS ~e love v
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More than three arguments must all be Latin words.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>WORDS amo amas amat amamus amatis amant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There cannot be more than one English word in the argument list,
since there can only be one English word per line for WORDS input.</p>

<p>An input file (either from interactive with @ or from command line)
can have changes of language, but the ~E or ~L must be on a separate line.
Note that this capability can create confusing situations.
An input file that starts off Latin then switches to English will be
correctly processed.  But if it is followed by a similar input file, the
second file will start off English (from the setting in the earlier file) a=
nd fail
on the Latin input.  Thus even submitting the same file twice in a run
will give different results.  This problem can be alleviated by starting ea=
ch
input file with an explicit language instruction, but this will not normall=
y be
the situation.</p>

<h2 id=3D"latin-to-english-examples">Latin-to-English Examples</h2>

<p>Following are annotated examples of output.  Examination of these will
give a good idea of the system.  The present version may not match these
examples exactly - things are changing - but the principle is there.  A
recent modification is the output of dictionary forms or =E2=80=98principal=
 parts=E2=80=99
(shown below for some examples).</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>=3D&gt;agricolarum
agricol.arum         N      1 1 GEN P M
agricola, agricolae  N    M   [XAXBO]
farmer, cultivator, gardener, agriculturist; plowman, countryman, peasant;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a simple first declension noun, and a unique interpretation.  Th=
e
=E2=80=981 1=E2=80=99 means it is first declension, with variant 1. This is=
 an internal
coding of the program, and may not correspond exactly with the grammatical
numbering.  The =E2=80=98N=E2=80=99 means it is a noun.  It is the form for=
 genitive
(GEN), plural (=E2=80=98P=E2=80=99).  The stem is masculine (M).
The stem is given as =E2=80=98agricol=E2=80=99 and the ending is
=E2=80=98arum=E2=80=99.  The stem is normal in this case, but is a product =
of the program,
and may not always correspond to conventional usage.</p>

<p>On the next line is given the expansion of the form that one might find
in a paper dictionary, the nominative and genitive (agricola, agricolae).
The [XAXBO] is an internal code of the program and is documented below as D=
ictionary Codes.
Several codes are associated with each dictionary entry (presently AGE, ARE=
A, GEO, FREQ, SOURCE).
These provide some information to enhance the interpretation of the diction=
ary entry.
In this case, the interesting piece is the B, which signifies
that this word is found frequently in texts, in the top 10 percent.
The O says it has been verified in the Oxford Latin Dictionary.
The A says it is an agricultural word.</p>

<p>The declension/conjugation numbers for nouns and verbs are
essentially arbitrary (but will be familiar to Latin students).
The variants are complete inventions.
They have no real meaning, just codes for the program.</p>

<p>(In the case of adjectives, they are even more arbitrary,
although a Latin student might see how I came by them.
Again they are only codes for the program.
The initial release of the program did not put these out,
but there is some interest on the part of students, so they are now include=
d.
The user may ignore them altogether.
There is no relation between the declension/variant codes of a noun
and the accompanying adjective.
They only agree in case, number, and gender (NOM S N),
which are listed in the output.)</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=
"><pre class=3D"highlight"><code>=3D&gt;feminae

<p>This word has several possible interpretations in case and number
(Singular and Plural).  The gender is Feminine.  Presumably, the user can
examine the adjoining words and reduce the set of possibilities.</p>

<div class=3D"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class=3D"highlight=

<p>Here is an example of another declension and two variants.  The
Masculine (and few Feminine) (-us) nouns of the declension are =E2=80=984 1=
=E2=80=99 and the Neuter
(-u) nouns are coded as =E2=80=984 2=E2=80=99.  This word has both.
The horn parse is very frequent (A), while the cornel option (C) is
less so but still common.</p>

<p>A pronoun is much like a noun.  The gender is common (C), that is, it ma=
y
be masculine or feminine.  For some odd words, especially including pronoun=
s,
there is no dictionary form given.</p>

<p>Here there is a prefix and a base.  The user must make the combination

<p>Generally, the meaning is given for the base word, as is usual for
dictionaries.  For the verb, it will be a present meaning, even when the
tense given is perfect.  For a noun, it will be the singular, and the user
must interpret when the form is plural.</p>

<p>For an adjective, the positive meaning is given,
even if a comparative or superlative form is output.
The user is invited to expand to
comparative (-er) and superlative (-est).
For a few adjectives, the only stem in the dictionary is COMP or SUPER.
When there is just one comparison,
the WORDS dictionary gives that expanded meaning.
This might be considered inconsistent,
in that it expects the user to observe the FORM to interpret the meaning,
but it is consistent with ordinary dictionary practice.</p>

<p>Initially there were more defective adjective entries.
I had accepted assertions in OLD or L+S and others like
=E2=80=98comparative does not exist=E2=80=99.
Later on I went over to the position that
even if Cicero did not use it, someone might.
I started generating COMP and SUPER where it seemed reasonable.
One can also count on a suffix to correct most omissions, and it will.</p>

<p>Sometimes a word is constructed from a suffix and a stem of a different
part of speech.
Thus an adverb may be constructed from its adjective.
It will show the base adjective meaning and an indication of how to
make the adverb in English.  The user must make the proper interpretation.<=
/p>

<p>In some cases an adjective will be found that is a participle of a verb
that is also found.  The participle meaning, as inferred by the user from
the verb meaning, is not superseded by the explicit adjective entry, but
supplemented by it with possible specialized meanings.</p>

<p>A single input English word is followed by the desired part of speech.
Omitting the part of speech defaults to all, which is not recommended
for any word which can be ambiguous.  Since the program is looking for a
part of speech, it would be inconvenient to support the input of several
English words on a line.  While a (@) file of words can be processed in the
English mode, it must be one word per line.</p>

in selecting the best translation.  The output may also contain a vertical =

<p>While six prioritized translations may seem like enough,
and they will likely cover the needs of a student, the full set
(setting # parameter to not TRIM) contains much valuable information
for the advanced translator.  For instance for the verb live vivo
usually works, but there are other options associated with specific
situations: cohabito means live together, ruror means live in the country,
adjaceo means live near, judaizo means live in the Jewish manner keeping th=
e law.
These sorts of meanings are often conveyed in Latin by a single word,
while in English one might just use live and a modifying word or phrase.</p=

<h2 id=3D"design-of-the-meaning-line">Design of the Meaning Line</h2>

<p>The role and complexity of the WORDS meaning line has evolved over time.
Initially it reflected an elementary, back-of-the-book,  textbook dictionar=
y
with a single word or two for each entry.
Nevertheless, the size of the MEAN element was set at 80 characters
(as God, Holerith and IBM decreed),
as appropriate for a standard computer screen in text mode.
(Depending on the system and mode of display, the output
may be limited to 78 or 79 characters, but the traditional 80
characters of the century-old IBM card was chosen.
They will likely appear on printed output.)</p>

<p>With expansion of the dictionary beyond a few thousand elementary entrie=
s
and the extensive inclusion of the Oxford dictionaries,
a much larger set of possible interpretations surfaced for many words,
filling and exceeding the 80 character limit.
A certain discipline was introduced to structure the line.</p>

<p>Through the many phases of development of the
dictionary, standards were developed and modified and
rigor was not always maintained, therefore the rules
below are generally, but not universally, observed.
Evolution of the dictionary is bringing it more closely
in line with these rules.</p>

<p>A decision was made to include as many meanings and synonyms as
convenient.  The OLD will sometimes list a dozen or more meaning
groups with notably different senses, each with several similar meanings.
Presumably these different meanings were the product of different
translations of the Latin word, different translators,
different context, and different eras.
The WORDS dictionary includes many of these synonyms, and specifically adds
some more modern ones, in order to give the user inspiration
for his translation.
Further, it is important to give the user the full flavor of the word
that various translations employ.  A word with a nominal meaning of
respect may be found to also mean fear (which may be the basis of all
respect for the Romans), and that will certainly color the interpretation
of a passage.
Going the other way, one might not want to
apply it to a description of Mother Teressa.
Also one should be warned if an otherwise simple word also is used as a rud=
e
reference to female anatomy.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other factors that may influence the user in deter=
mining
the appropriate meaning from the list.  Some words have different meanings =
depending
on the age.  If one is reading a text written recently in modern Latin, one=
 must
consider hints about the meaning.  While the classical meaning, the WORDS d=
efault,
may be appropriate, if there is a line with a late AGE code or an indicatio=
n
of a modern dictionary source (e.g,. Cal), the user should take this into c=
onsideration.</p>
